This license grants permission to use, share, and build upon the materials in this repository for non-commercial, faith-aligned, research-driven purposes only.

• Non-commercial means no direct profit; fundraising or services are allowed if proceeds support open-source, non-profit goals aligned with EkonAI’s mission.  
• Faith-aligned means consistent with the Mool Mantar’s spiritual principles:
  - Oneness (Ik Onkar)
  - Truth (Sat Naam)
  - Fearlessness (Nirbhau)
  - Compassion (Nirvair)
  - Timelessness (Akal Moorat)  
  e.g., promoting dignity over coercion.

• Share includes distributing modified versions, which must use this license.  
• Build upon includes training AI models, provided outputs remain non-commercial and faith-aligned.

Commercial use, redistribution for profit, integration into closed-source large language models, or modification for unethical purposes (e.g., coercion, harm) is prohibited unless explicitly licensed through Bayant Dhindsa or designated representatives of the EkonAI team.
